"""Installer: apply an :class:`InstallPlan` via existing primitive machinery.

The actual component installation (extensions, presets, steps, workflows) is
delegated to a :class:`PrimitiveInstaller` so the bundler never re-implements
primitive logic (Principle I) and integration tests can inject a deterministic,
offline fake (Principle II/IV). The real adapter dispatches in-process to the
existing extension/preset/step/workflow machinery.

Installation is idempotent and stops on first failure with no partial record
write (FR-018, SC partial-failure-stop).

    Atomicity is scoped, not global: on failure only the components newly
    installed during *this* call are rolled back, and the provenance record is
    written solely on full success (a failure records nothing). Components that
    were already installed beforehand — including those re-applied when *refresh*
    is True — are never rolled back.

    When *refresh* is True (used by ``specify bundle update``), components that
    are already installed are re-applied through the primitive machinery so they
    are brought up to the plan's pinned versions, rather than skipped. Primitive
    config (e.g. preset priority overrides) is preserved by the underlying
    machinery.

    Version-pin enforcement is install-time only. The primitive ``is_installed``
    checks are id-based (they do not compare versions), so when a component is
    already present and *refresh* is False it is skipped without verifying that
    the on-disk version matches the manifest pin. Pins are therefore only
    guaranteed to be applied when the bundler actually performs an install or a
    refresh; running ``specify bundle update`` re-applies every owned component
    at its pinned version.
