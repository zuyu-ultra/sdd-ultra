    Every step type — built-in or extension-provided — implements this

    a concurrent ``fan-out`` (``max_concurrency > 1``) can invoke ``execute`` on
    the same instance from several threads at once. Implementations must be
    stateless / thread-safe — derive all per-run state from the ``config`` and
