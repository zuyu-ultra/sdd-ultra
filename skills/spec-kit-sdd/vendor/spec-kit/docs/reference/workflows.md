# Workflows

Workflows automate multi-step Spec-Driven Development processes — chaining commands, prompts, shell steps, and human checkpoints into repeatable sequences. They support conditional logic, loops, fan-out/fan-in, and can be paused and resumed from the exact point of interruption.

## Run a Workflow

```bash
specify workflow run <source>
```

| Option              | Description                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-i` / `--input`    | Pass input values as `key=value` (repeatable)            |
| `--json`            | Emit the run outcome as a single JSON object             |

Runs a workflow from a catalog ID, URL, or local file path. Inputs declared by the workflow can be provided via `--input` or will be prompted interactively.

Example:

```bash
specify workflow run speckit -i spec="Build a kanban board with drag-and-drop task management" -i scope=full
```

With `--json`, a single machine-readable object is printed instead of formatted text (the default output is unchanged when the flag is omitted):

```bash
specify workflow run my-pipeline.yml --json
```

```json
{
  "run_id": "662bf791",
  "workflow_id": "build-and-review",
  "status": "paused",
  "current_step_id": "review",
  "current_step_index": 0
}
```

`workflow_id` is the `workflow.id` declared inside the YAML, not the file name. The object is printed exactly as shown — pretty-printed with two-space indentation, on plain stdout with no Rich markup — so it always parses. While the workflow runs under `--json`, any progress a step would print (for example a gate prompt, or output from a prompt step's CLI subprocess) is redirected to stderr, so stdout carries only the JSON object. Read the object from stdout; leave stderr attached to the terminal or capture it separately.

For `failed` and `aborted` runs, the payload includes an `error` field carrying the terminal step's error message:

```json
{
  "run_id": "662bf791",
  "workflow_id": "build-and-review",
  "status": "failed",
  "current_step_id": "boom",
  "current_step_index": 0,
  "error": "Command exited with code 3"
}
```

`completed` and `paused` runs omit the `error` field. The error is persisted in the run's `state.json`, so `specify workflow status <run_id> --json` surfaces the same message after the fact.

> **Note:** Most workflow commands require a project already initialized with `specify init`. The exception is `specify workflow run <local-file.{yml,yaml}>`, which can run outside a project; in that case, run state is stored under the current directory's `.specify/workflows/runs/<run_id>/`.

## Resume a Workflow

```bash
specify workflow resume <run_id>
```

| Option              | Description                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-i` / `--input`    | Updated input values as `key=value` (repeatable)         |
| `--json`            | Emit the resume outcome as a single JSON object          |

Resumes a paused or failed workflow run from the exact step where it stopped. Useful after responding to a gate step or fixing an issue that caused a failure.

Supplied `--input` values are merged over the run's stored inputs and re-validated against the workflow's input types, then the blocked step is re-run with the updated values. This lets a run continue with information that only became available after it paused, or with a corrected value after a failure:

```bash
specify workflow resume <run_id> --input cmd="exit 0"
```

## Workflow Status

```bash
specify workflow status [<run_id>]
```

| Option              | Description                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--json`            | Emit run status (or the runs list) as a JSON object      |

Shows the status of a specific run, or lists all runs if no ID is given. Run states: `created`, `running`, `completed`, `paused`, `failed`, `aborted`.

## List Installed Workflows

```bash
specify workflow list
```

Lists workflows installed in the current project.

## Install a Workflow

```bash
specify workflow add <source>
```

| Option          | Description                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--dev`         | Install from a local YAML file, package directory, or archive |
| `--from <url>`  | Install from a custom URL (`<source>` names the expected workflow ID) |

Installs a workflow from the catalog, an HTTPS URL, a local YAML file, a
directory containing `workflow.yml`, or a `.zip`, `.tar.gz`, or `.tgz`
archive. Archives may contain `workflow.yml` at the root or inside one
top-level directory.

Directory and archive installs preserve the complete workflow package,
including scripts and other companion files. ZIP, `.tar.gz`, and `.tgz`
archives follow the same validation and installation behavior.

## Workflow Overlays

Workflow overlays let a project extend or override an installed workflow without editing the installed `workflow.yml`.  This keeps local customizations safe across `specify bundle update` or `specify workflow add` upgrades.

When `specify workflow run <workflow-id>` loads a workflow, the engine composes the base workflow with all enabled overlays for that workflow id.  The result is validated like any other workflow definition.

### How Overlays Work

An overlay is a YAML file that declares a set of edit operations against the step list of a base workflow. Overlays use lower-wins precedence: higher priority numbers are applied first and lower numbers last. Equal-priority overlays are applied alphabetically by ID, with the last ID winning conflicts.

Project overlay files live at:

| Location | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.specify/workflows/overlays/<id>/*.yml` | Project-local customizations |

### Overlay File Format

The recommended edit format uses the operation name as the key and the anchor step id as the value:

```yaml
id: "my-overlay"
extends: "speckit"
priority: 10
enabled: true
edits:
  - insert_after: implement
    step:
      id: run-lint
      type: shell
      run: "ruff check src/"

  - replace: review-spec
    step:
      id: review-spec
      type: gate
      message: "Review the generated spec (overlay override)."
      options: [approve, reject]
      on_reject: abort
```

The explicit form is also supported:

```yaml
edits:
  - operation: insert_after
    anchor: implement
    step:
      id: run-lint
      type: shell
      run: "ruff check src/"
```

#### Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | yes | Identifier for this overlay. Used in `specify workflow overlay *` commands. Must be lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only; no dots, underscores, path separators, or `overlays`. |
| `extends` | yes | The workflow id this overlay applies to. Uses the same safe-id format as `id`; `overlays`, `runs`, and `steps` are reserved. |
| `priority` | no | Integer; defaults to `10`. Lower values have higher precedence and win conflicts. Missing or invalid values fall back to `10`. |
| `enabled` | no | Boolean. Defaults to `true`. Disabled overlays are ignored. |
| `edits` | yes | Non-empty list of edit operations. |

#### Edit Operations

| Operation | `step` required | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `insert_after` | yes | Insert `step` immediately after the anchor step. |
| `insert_before` | yes | Insert `step` immediately before the anchor step. |
| `replace` | yes | Replace the anchor step with `step`. |
| `remove` | no | Remove the anchor step from the list. |

The `anchor` is the `id` of a step in the base workflow.  Anchors are resolved recursively inside `then`, `else`, `steps`, `cases.*`, and `default` blocks, so nested base steps can also be targeted.  Fan-out templates (`step` inside a `fan-out` step) are **not** valid anchors.

Step ids must not contain `:` — that character is reserved for engine-generated nested ids.

### Overlay CLI Commands

#### Add a Project Overlay

```bash
specify workflow overlay add <path-to-overlay.yml> --priority <n>
```

Validates the overlay file and copies it to `.specify/workflows/overlays/<extends>/<id>.yml`. `--priority` defaults to `10` and overrides the `priority` field in the file.

#### List Overlays

```bash
specify workflow overlay list <workflow-id>
```

Shows all overlays for the workflow, ordered by resolver precedence. Disabled overlays are marked as disabled in the listing and are ignored during workflow resolution.

#### Change Priority

```bash
specify workflow overlay set-priority <workflow-id> <overlay-id> <n>
```

#### Enable or Disable

```bash
specify workflow overlay disable <workflow-id> <overlay-id>
specify workflow overlay enable <workflow-id> <overlay-id>
```

#### Remove

```bash
specify workflow overlay remove <workflow-id> <overlay-id>
```

Removes the project overlay file.

#### Inspect the Composed Workflow

```bash
specify workflow resolve <workflow-id>
```

Prints the layer stack (base + overlays) and the source attribution for each step after composition.  Useful for debugging which overlay contributed or overrode a step.

### Example: Adding Automated Linting after Implementation

Given the built-in `speckit` workflow, create `project-overlay.yml`:

```yaml
id: "add-lint"
extends: "speckit"
priority: 10
edits:
  - insert_after: implement
    step:
      id: run-lint
      type: shell
      run: "ruff check src/"
```

Install it:

```bash
specify workflow overlay add project-overlay.yml --priority 10
```

Run the workflow:

```bash
specify workflow run speckit -i spec="Build a kanban board"
```

The composed workflow will now run the full SDD cycle and execute `ruff check src/` automatically after the `implement` step.

### Example: Replacing a Gate

```yaml
id: "skip-plan-review"
extends: "speckit"
priority: 5
edits:
  - replace: review-plan
    step:
      id: review-plan
      type: command
      command: speckit.plan
      input:
        args: "{{ inputs.spec }}"
```

Lower priority values have higher precedence. Change this overlay to `priority: 5` if it must win a conflict with the `add-lint` overlay above. It replaces the `review-plan` gate with a non-interactive command.

### Interaction with Bundles and Updates

`specify workflow add <local-directory>` installs the complete local workflow
package into `.specify/workflows/<id>/`. Archive installs preserve the same
package contents.

When an installed workflow is refreshed or reinstalled, project overlays in `.specify/workflows/overlays/<id>/` are preserved because they live outside the installed workflow directory.

### Limitations

- Overlays operate on the step list only.  They cannot change workflow metadata (name, description, inputs, `requires`) or expression logic.
- Fan-out templates cannot be used as anchors.
- An overlay that targets a step id that does not exist in the base workflow will raise a validation error when the workflow is resolved.
- Overlays cannot target steps added by other overlays.
- Overlays cannot add new inputs or change the input schema of the base workflow.
## Update Workflows

```bash
specify workflow update [workflow_id]
```

Updates one installed catalog workflow — or all of them when no ID is given — to the latest catalog version. Prompts for confirmation and keeps the installed copy if a download or validation fails.

## Enable or Disable a Workflow

```bash
specify workflow enable <workflow_id>
specify workflow disable <workflow_id>
```

Disabled workflows stay installed and listed (marked `[disabled]`) but refuse to run until re-enabled.

## Remove a Workflow

```bash
specify workflow remove <workflow_id>
```

Removes an installed workflow from the project.

## Search Available Workflows

```bash
specify workflow search [query]
```

| Option     | Description       |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| `--tag`    | Filter by tag     |
| `--author` | Filter by author  |

Searches all active catalogs for workflows matching the query.

## Workflow Info

```bash
specify workflow info <workflow_id>
```

Shows detailed information about a workflow, including its steps, inputs, and requirements.

## Catalog Management

Workflow catalogs control where `search` and `add` look for workflows. Catalogs are checked in priority order.

### List Catalogs

```bash
specify workflow catalog list
```

Shows all active catalog sources.

### Add a Catalog

```bash
specify workflow catalog add <url>
```

| Option          | Description                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `--name <name>` | Optional name for the catalog    |

Adds a custom catalog URL to the project's `.specify/workflow-catalogs.yml`.

### Remove a Catalog

```bash
specify workflow catalog remove <index>
```

Removes a catalog by its index in the catalog list.

### Catalog Resolution Order

Catalogs are resolved in this order (first match wins):

1. **Environment variable** — `SPECKIT_WORKFLOW_CATALOG_URL` overrides all catalogs
2. **Project config** — `.specify/workflow-catalogs.yml`
3. **User config** — `~/.specify/workflow-catalogs.yml`
4. **Built-in defaults** — official catalog + community catalog

## Workflow Definition

Workflows are defined in YAML files. Here is the built-in **Full SDD Cycle** workflow that ships with Spec Kit:

```yaml
schema_version: "1.0"
workflow:
  id: "speckit"
  name: "Full SDD Cycle"
  version: "1.0.0"
  author: "GitHub"
  description: "Runs specify → plan → tasks → implement with review gates"

requires:
  speckit_version: ">=0.7.2"
  integrations:
    any: ["copilot", "claude", "gemini"]

inputs:
  spec:
    type: string
    required: true
    prompt: "Describe what you want to build"
  integration:
    type: string
    default: "copilot"
    prompt: "Integration to use (e.g. claude, copilot, gemini)"
  scope:
    type: string
    default: "full"
    enum: ["full", "backend-only", "frontend-only"]

steps:
  - id: specify
    command: speckit.specify
    integration: "{{ inputs.integration }}"
    input:
      args: "{{ inputs.spec }}"

  - id: review-spec
    type: gate
    message: "Review the generated spec before planning."
    options: [approve, reject]
    on_reject: abort

  - id: plan
    command: speckit.plan
    integration: "{{ inputs.integration }}"
    input:
      args: "{{ inputs.spec }}"

  - id: review-plan
    type: gate
    message: "Review the plan before generating tasks."
    options: [approve, reject]
    on_reject: abort

  - id: tasks
    command: speckit.tasks
    integration: "{{ inputs.integration }}"
    input:
      args: "{{ inputs.spec }}"

  - id: implement
    command: speckit.implement
    integration: "{{ inputs.integration }}"
    input:
      args: "{{ inputs.spec }}"
```

This produces the following execution flow:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A["specify<br/>(command)"] --> B{"review-spec<br/>(gate)"}
    B -- approve --> C["plan<br/>(command)"]
    B -- reject --> X1["⏹ Abort"]
    C --> D{"review-plan<br/>(gate)"}
    D -- approve --> E["tasks<br/>(command)"]
    D -- reject --> X2["⏹ Abort"]
    E --> F["implement<br/>(command)"]

    style A fill:#49a,color:#fff
    style B fill:#a94,color:#fff
    style C fill:#49a,color:#fff
    style D fill:#a94,color:#fff

    style F fill:#49a,color:#fff
    style X1 fill:#999,color:#fff
    style X2 fill:#999,color:#fff
```

Run it with:

```bash
specify workflow run speckit -i spec="Build a kanban board with drag-and-drop task management"
```

## Step Types

| Type         | Purpose                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `command`    | Invoke a Spec Kit command (e.g., `speckit.plan`) |
| `prompt`     | Send an arbitrary prompt to the AI coding agent  |
| `shell`      | Execute a shell command and capture output       |
| `init`       | Bootstrap a project (like `specify init`)        |
| `gate`       | Pause for human approval before continuing       |
| `if`         | Conditional branching (then/else)                |
| `switch`     | Multi-branch dispatch on an expression           |
| `while`      | Loop while a condition is true                   |
| `do-while`   | Execute at least once, then loop on condition    |
| `fan-out`    | Dispatch a step for each item in a list          |
| `fan-in`     | Aggregate results from a fan-out step            |

> **Security note:** a `shell` step runs a local command with **your** privileges. There is no capability sandbox — `requires` is an advisory pre-condition block (spec-kit version, integrations), not a runtime gate, so it does **not** restrict what a step can do. In particular there is no `requires.permissions` capability gate: it is rejected by validation precisely because it would imply a sandbox that does not exist. Review any catalog or downloaded workflow before running it, and use a `gate` step to require explicit approval before sensitive or destructive shell commands.

## Expressions

Steps can reference inputs and previous step outputs using `{{ expression }}` syntax:

| Namespace                      | Description                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `inputs.spec`                  | Workflow input values                |
| `steps.specify.output.file`    | Output from a previous step          |
| `item`                         | Current item in a fan-out iteration  |
| `context.run_id`               | Current workflow run ID              |
| `context.workflow_dir`         | Resolved absolute path to the workflow source directory. Empty string for string-loaded workflows. |

Available filters: `default`, `join`, `contains`, `map`, `from_json`.

Example:

```yaml
condition: "{{ steps.test.output.exit_code == 0 }}"
args: "{{ inputs.spec }}"
message: "{{ status | default('pending') }}"
```

### Interpolation and shell safety

Expressions are resolved by **plain string substitution** — the value of `{{ ... }}` is spliced into the surrounding text exactly as-is, with no quoting or escaping added. That is convenient for building `args` and `message` strings, but it has an important consequence for `shell` steps: a `run` field is handed to the system shell (`/bin/sh -c` on POSIX), so any interpolated value is interpreted as **shell syntax**, not just data.

If an interpolated value can contain characters like `;`, `|`, `&`, `$( )`, backticks, or quotes, it can change or extend the command that actually runs. This matters most when the value is not fully under the workflow author's control:

- **Workflow `inputs.*`** — supplied by whoever runs the workflow.
- **A prior step's output**, e.g. `{{ steps.plan.output.stdout }}` — for a `prompt` step this is **text produced by the AI agent**, which can in turn be influenced by files, tickets, or web content the agent read. Treat agent output as untrusted when it flows into a `shell` step.

There is **no shell-escaping filter** in the expression language and **no sandbox** around a `shell` step, so none of the practices below can be treated as a guarantee that a hostile value is neutralised. The only reliable control is to constrain what an interpolated value *can* be, and to keep values you cannot constrain out of `run` fields entirely. Scrutinise every `run` field that interpolates a value you do not control, and at minimum:

- **Constrain the value at the source with `enum`/an allowlist.** When `inputs.*` feeds a `run` field, restrict it to a fixed set of known-safe values so a caller cannot supply arbitrary shell text at all. This is the strongest control the engine offers — prefer it over any downstream mitigation.

  ```yaml
  inputs:
    target:
      type: string
      enum: [staging, production]   # caller cannot inject arbitrary text
  ```

- **Keep unconstrained values out of `run`.** If a value cannot be constrained to an allowlist — most agent/`prompt` output — do not interpolate it into a `run` field. Branch on it with `if`/`switch` against fixed conditions, or act on it in a `command`/`prompt` step rather than a shell command built from it.
- **Quoting is not a security boundary.** Surrounding a substitution with quotes (`'{{ inputs.x }}'`) helps the shell treat a *trusted* value as a single argument and avoids word-splitting on spaces, but a value that itself contains the matching quote character can still break out and inject shell syntax. Quote for correctness on constrained values; never rely on quoting to make an *unconstrained* substitution safe.
- **Gates do not inspect the next step, and `message` is printed verbatim.** A `gate` step renders only its own `message`/`show_file` — it does not display, resolve, or sanitise the command that follows it, and approval never neutralises an injectable interpolation. Do **not** interpolate raw untrusted data into `message`: it is printed as-is with no control-character stripping, so agent or caller output could inject terminal/ANSI escapes that alter or hide the approval prompt. Keep `message` to trusted, constrained text, and surface untrusted material for review via `show_file` instead — its path and contents are control/ANSI-stripped before display.

A `shell` step is an arbitrary-command primitive by design; these practices reduce exposure and keep *which* command runs under the author's control, but they do not eliminate the risk of interpolating values you do not fully control.

## Shell Step Environment Variables

Shell steps automatically receive the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `SPECKIT_WORKFLOW_DIR` | Resolved absolute path to the workflow source directory (same value as `{{ context.workflow_dir }}`). Not set when the workflow has no source path. |

## Input Types

| Type      | Coercion                                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `string`  | Pass-through                                      |
| `number`  | `"42"` → `42`, `"3.14"` → `3.14`                 |
| `boolean` | `"true"` / `"1"` / `"yes"` → `True`              |

## State and Resume

Each workflow run persists its state at `.specify/workflows/runs/<run_id>/`:

- `state.json` — current run state and step progress
- `inputs.json` — resolved input values
- `log.jsonl` — step-by-step execution log

This enables `specify workflow resume` to continue from the exact step where a run was paused (e.g., at a gate) or failed.

### Gate Verdict Inputs

`verdict_input` binds a gate's verdict to a named workflow input. The input must be declared in the workflow's `inputs` block; `specify workflow validate` reports an undeclared reference.

`verdict_input` is not supported inside a `fan-out` template. Fan-out items
share workflow inputs, while workflow state can represent only one paused
gate. Place a gate before the fan-out to approve the whole batch, or after a
fan-in to review the aggregated results.

**Input value semantics:**

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Non-empty string, matches an option (case-insensitive) | Gate auto-decides; `output.choice` is set to the configured option spelling |
| Non-empty string, no match | Gate fails immediately |
| Non-string | Gate fails immediately |
| Missing or empty | Gate prompts on a TTY; pauses otherwise |

**Default value semantics:** A non-empty `default` is consumed as a verdict on the first run — matching an option auto-decides the gate, not matching fails it immediately.

```yaml
inputs:
  spec_verdict:
    type: string
    default: ""
steps:
  - id: review-spec
    type: gate
    message: "Approve the specification?"
    options: [approve, reject]
    on_reject: retry
    verdict_input: spec_verdict
```

Supply a verdict when resuming:

```bash
specify workflow resume <run_id> --input spec_verdict=approve
```

For `on_reject: retry`, a bound reject verdict is consumed before the gate
pauses: the named stored input is reset to `""`. A later resume therefore
prompts or pauses again until another verdict is supplied. Approve, abort, and
skip outcomes leave the input unchanged.

Because of that reset, a verdict input used with `on_reject: retry` must accept
`""`. If it declares an `enum`, include the empty string — otherwise the reset
value violates the input's own `enum` and the run can no longer be resumed with
any input. `specify workflow add` reports this as a validation error.

```yaml
inputs:
  spec_verdict:
    type: string
    enum: ["", approve, reject]
    default: ""
```

## FAQ

### What happens when a workflow hits a gate step?

The workflow pauses and waits for human input. Run `specify workflow resume <run_id>` after reviewing to continue.

### Can I run the same workflow multiple times?

Yes. Each run gets a unique ID and its own state directory. Use `specify workflow status` to see all runs.

### Who maintains workflows?

Most workflows are independently created and maintained by their respective authors. The Spec Kit maintainers do not review, audit, endorse, or support workflow code. Review a workflow's source before installing and use at your own discretion.
