# Presets

Presets customize how Spec Kit works — overriding templates, commands, and terminology without changing any tooling. They let you enforce organizational standards, adapt the workflow to your methodology, or localize the entire experience. Multiple presets can be stacked with priority ordering.

## Search Available Presets

```bash
specify preset search [query]
```

| Option     | Description          |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| `--tag`    | Filter by tag        |
| `--author` | Filter by author     |

Searches all active catalogs for presets matching the query. Without a query, lists all available presets.

## Install a Preset

```bash
specify preset add [<preset_id>]
```

| Option           | Description                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--dev <path>`   | Install from a local directory (for development)         |
| `--from <url>`   | Install from a custom URL instead of the catalog         |
| `--priority <N>` | Resolution priority (default: 10; lower = higher precedence) |

Installs a preset from the catalog, a URL, or a local directory. Preset commands are automatically registered with the currently installed AI coding agent integration.

> **Note:** All preset commands require a project already initialized with `specify init`.

## Remove a Preset

```bash
specify preset remove <preset_id>
```

Removes an installed preset and cleans up its registered commands.

## List Installed Presets

```bash
specify preset list
```

Lists installed presets with their versions, descriptions, template counts, and current status.

Presets are printed in **resolution/precedence order**: the highest-precedence preset (lowest priority number) is listed first, and ties on priority are broken alphabetically by preset id. This matches the order used when composing commands and resolving templates, so the top entry is the one that wins for overlapping files.

## Preset Info

```bash
specify preset info <preset_id>
```

Shows detailed information about an installed or available preset, including its templates, metadata, and tags.

## Resolve a File

```bash
specify preset resolve <name>
```

Shows which file will be used for a given name by tracing the full resolution stack. Useful for debugging when multiple presets provide the same file.

## Enable / Disable a Preset

```bash
specify preset enable <preset_id>
specify preset disable <preset_id>
```

Disable a preset without removing it. Disabled presets are skipped during file resolution but their commands remain registered. Re-enable with `enable`.

## Set Preset Priority

```bash
specify preset set-priority <preset_id> <priority>
```

Changes the resolution priority of an installed preset. Lower numbers take precedence. When multiple presets provide the same file, the one with the lowest priority number wins.

## Catalog Management

Preset catalogs control where `search` and `add` look for presets. Catalogs are checked in priority order (lower number = higher precedence).

### List Catalogs

```bash
specify preset catalog list
```

Shows all active catalogs with their priorities and install permissions.

### Add a Catalog

```bash
specify preset catalog add <url>
```

| Option                                       | Description                                        |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `--name <name>`                              | Required. Unique name for the catalog              |
| `--priority <N>`                             | Priority (default: 10; lower = higher precedence)  |
| `--install-allowed / --no-install-allowed`   | Whether presets can be installed from this catalog (default: discovery only) |
| `--description <text>`                       | Optional description                               |

Adds a catalog to the project's `.specify/preset-catalogs.yml`.

### Remove a Catalog

```bash
specify preset catalog remove <name>
```

Removes a catalog from the project configuration.

### Catalog Resolution Order

Catalogs are resolved in this order (first match wins):

1. **Environment variable** — `SPECKIT_PRESET_CATALOG_URL` overrides all catalogs
2. **Project config** — `.specify/preset-catalogs.yml`
3. **User config** — `~/.specify/preset-catalogs.yml`
4. **Built-in defaults** — official catalog + community catalog

Example `.specify/preset-catalogs.yml`:

```yaml
catalogs:
  - name: "my-org-presets"
    url: "https://example.com/preset-catalog.json"
    priority: 5
    install_allowed: true
    description: "Our approved presets"
```

## File Resolution

Presets can provide command files, template files (like `plan-template.md`), and script files. Each file name is evaluated independently against the priority stack, so different files can come from different layers.

Templates and scripts are looked up from the stack when Spec Kit needs them. Commands use the same stack for replacement and composition, but are materialized into the active integration's directory only, instead of being re-resolved by agents or written to every detected agent directory (#2948). During preset install, Spec Kit registers command files for the preset being installed against the currently active integration; post-install and post-removal reconciliation then recomputes and writes the effective command content for affected command names based on the active stack. Install and rescaffold remain active-only, but removal may also update previously targeted inactive directories recorded by the removed preset to restore the surviving command or skill layer. A non-active installed integration does not otherwise receive these command files until it becomes the default — `specify integration use <key>` (or `switch <key>`) rescaffolds enabled presets for the newly active integration. Agents do not re-resolve the stack each time they run a command.

By default, files use a **replace** strategy: the first match in the priority stack wins and is used entirely. Templates and commands can also use composition strategies: **prepend** places preset content before lower-priority content, **append** places it after lower-priority content, and **wrap** replaces `{CORE_TEMPLATE}` with lower-priority content. Scripts support **replace** and **wrap**; script wrappers use `$CORE_SCRIPT` as the placeholder.

The resolution stack, from highest to lowest precedence:

1. **Project-local overrides** — `.specify/templates/overrides/`
2. **Installed presets** — sorted by priority (lower = checked first)
3. **Installed extensions** — sorted by priority
4. **Spec Kit core** — `.specify/templates/`

### Resolution Stack

```mermaid

    subgraph stack [" "]
        direction TB
        A["⬆ Highest precedence<br/><br/>1. Project-local overrides<br/>.specify/templates/overrides/"]
        B["2. Presets — by priority<br/>.specify/presets/‹id›/"]
        C["3. Extensions — by priority<br/>.specify/extensions/‹id›/"]
        D["4. Spec Kit core<br/>.specify/templates/<br/><br/>⬇ Lowest precedence"]

    style C fill:#a94,color:#fff
    style D fill:#999,color:#fff
```

Within each layer, files are organized by type:

| Type      | Subdirectory   | Override path                              |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Templates | `templates/`   | `.specify/templates/overrides/`            |
| Commands  | `commands/`    | `.specify/templates/overrides/`            |
| Scripts   | `scripts/`     | `.specify/templates/overrides/scripts/`    |

### Resolution in Action

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A["File requested:<br/>plan-template.md"] --> B{"Project-local override?"}
    B -- Found --> Z["✓ Use this file"]
    B -- Not found --> C{"Preset: compliance<br/>(priority 5)"}
    C -- Found --> Z
    C -- Not found --> D{"Preset: team-workflow<br/>(priority 10)"}
    D -- Found --> Z
    D -- Not found --> E{"Extension files?"}
    E -- Found --> Z
    E -- Not found --> F["Spec Kit core"]
    F --> Z
```

### Example

```bash
specify preset add compliance --priority 5
specify preset add team-workflow --priority 10
```

For any file that both provide, `compliance` wins (priority 5 < 10). For files only one provides, that one is used. For files neither provides, the core default is used.

## FAQ

### Can I use multiple presets at the same time?

Yes. Presets stack by priority — each file is resolved independently from the highest-priority source that provides it. Use `specify preset set-priority` to control the order.

### How do I see which file is actually being used?

Run `specify preset resolve <name>` to trace the resolution stack and see which file wins.

### What's the difference between disabling and removing a preset?

**Disabling** (`specify preset disable`) keeps the preset installed but excludes it from future template and script resolution. Previously registered commands remain available in your AI coding agent until preset removal, so use removal when you need command changes to stop taking effect. Disabling is useful for temporarily testing template/script behavior without a preset, or comparing template/script output with and without it. Re-enable anytime with `specify preset enable`.

**Removing** (`specify preset remove`) fully uninstalls the preset — deletes its files, unregisters its commands from your AI coding agent, and removes it from the registry.

### Who maintains presets?

Most presets are independently created and maintained by their respective authors. The Spec Kit maintainers do not review, audit, endorse, or support preset code. Review a preset's source code before installing and use at your own discretion. For issues with a specific preset, contact its author or file an issue on the preset's repository.
