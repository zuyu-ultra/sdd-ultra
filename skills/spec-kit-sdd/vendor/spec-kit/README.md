## 🤔 What is Spec-Driven Development?

Spec-Driven Development **flips the script** on traditional software development. For decades, code has been king — specifications were just scaffolding we built and discarded once the "real work" of coding began. Spec-Driven Development changes this: **specifications become executable**, directly generating working implementations rather than just guiding them.

## ⚡ Get Started

### 1. Install Specify CLI

Requires **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** ([install uv](./docs/install/uv.md)). Replace `vX.Y.Z` with the latest release tag from [Releases](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/releases) — keep the leading `v` (for example, `v0.12.11`, not `0.12.11`):

```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git@vX.Y.Z
```

Prefer installing from PyPI? The `specify-cli` package is also published there:

```bash
uv tool install specify-cli
```

See the [Installation Guide](./docs/installation.md) for alternative methods, verification, upgrade, and troubleshooting.

### 2. Initialize a project

```bash
specify init my-project --integration copilot
cd my-project
```

To check for updates or upgrade the installed CLI, use the self-management commands. See the [Upgrade Guide](./docs/upgrade.md) for detailed scenarios and customization options.

```bash
# Check whether a newer release is available (read-only — does not modify anything)
specify self check

# Preview what would run, without actually upgrading
specify self upgrade --dry-run

# Upgrade in place to the latest stable release (auto-detects uv tool vs pipx install)
specify self upgrade

# Or pin a specific release tag (replace vX.Y.Z[suffix] with your desired release tag)
specify self upgrade --tag vX.Y.Z[suffix]
```

Bare `specify self upgrade` executes immediately, matching the no-prompt behavior of commands like `pip install -U` and `npm update`. For `uv tool` installs, it runs `uv tool install specify-cli --force --from <git ref>` under the hood so pinned release tags work, including dev, alpha/beta/rc, or build metadata suffixes. `uvx` (ephemeral) runs and source checkouts are detected and produce path-specific guidance instead of running an installer. Set `SPECIFY_UPGRADE_TIMEOUT_SECS` to cap how long the installer subprocess may run (default: no timeout — interrupt with `Ctrl+C` if needed).

### 3. Establish project principles

Launch your coding agent in the project directory. Most agents expose spec-kit as `/speckit.*` slash commands; Codex CLI and Command Code in skills mode use `$speckit-*` instead; GitHub Copilot CLI uses `/agents` to select the agent or address it directly in a prompt.

Use the **`/speckit.constitution`** command to create your project's governing principles and development guidelines that will guide all subsequent development.

```bash
/speckit.constitution Create principles focused on code quality, testing standards, user experience consistency, and performance requirements
```

### 4. Create the spec

Use the **`/speckit.specify`** command to describe what you want to build. Focus on the **what** and **why**, not the tech stack.

```bash
/speckit.specify Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. Albums are never in other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface.
```

### 5. Create a technical implementation plan

Use the **`/speckit.plan`** command to provide your tech stack and architecture choices.

```bash
/speckit.plan The application uses Vite with minimal number of libraries. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as much as possible. Images are not uploaded anywhere and metadata is stored in a local SQLite database.
```

### 6. Break down into tasks

Use **`/speckit.tasks`** to create an actionable task list from your implementation plan.

```bash
/speckit.tasks
```

### 7. Execute implementation

Use **`/speckit.implement`** to execute all tasks and build your feature according to the plan.

```bash
/speckit.implement
```

For detailed step-by-step instructions, see our [comprehensive guide](./spec-driven.md).

## 🤖 Supported AI Coding Agent Integrations

Spec Kit works with 30+ AI coding agents — both CLI tools and IDE-based assistants. See the full list with notes and usage details in the [Supported AI Coding Agent Integrations](https://github.github.io/spec-kit/reference/integrations.html) guide.

Run `specify integration list` to see all available integrations in your installed version.

## Available Slash Commands

After running `specify init`, your AI coding agent will have access to these slash commands for structured development. For integrations that support skills mode, passing `--integration <agent> --integration-options="--skills"` installs agent skills instead of slash-command prompt files.

### Core Commands

Essential commands for the Spec-Driven Development workflow:

| Command                  | Agent Skill            | Description                                                                |

## 🧩 Making Spec Kit Your Own: Extensions & Presets

Spec Kit can be tailored to your needs through two complementary systems — **extensions** and **presets** — plus project-local overrides for one-off adjustments:

| Priority | Component Type                                    | Location                         |
| -------: | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
|      ⬆ 1 | Project-Local Overrides                           | `.specify/templates/overrides/`  |
|        2 | Presets — Customize core & extensions             | `.specify/presets/templates/`    |
|        3 | Extensions — Add new capabilities                 | `.specify/extensions/templates/` |
|      ⬇ 4 | Spec Kit Core — Built-in SDD commands & templates | `.specify/templates/`            |

- **Templates** are resolved at **runtime** — Spec Kit walks the stack top-down and uses the first match.
- Project-local overrides (`.specify/templates/overrides/`) let you make one-off adjustments for a single project without creating a full preset.
- **Extension/preset commands** are applied at **install time** — when you run `specify extension add` or `specify preset add`, command files are written into agent directories (e.g., `.claude/commands/`).
- If multiple presets or extensions provide the same command, the highest-priority version wins. On removal, the next-highest-priority version is restored automatically.
- If no overrides or customizations exist, Spec Kit uses its core defaults.

### Extensions — Add New Capabilities

Use **extensions** when you need functionality that goes beyond Spec Kit's core. Extensions introduce new commands and templates — for example, adding domain-specific workflows that are not covered by the built-in SDD commands, integrating with external tools, or adding entirely new development phases. They expand *what Spec Kit can do*.

```bash
# Search available extensions
specify extension search

# Install an extension
specify extension add <extension-name>
```

For example, extensions could add Jira integration, post-implementation code review, V-Model test traceability, or project health diagnostics.

See the [Extensions reference](https://github.github.io/spec-kit/reference/extensions.html) for the full command guide. Browse the [community extensions](https://github.github.io/spec-kit/community/extensions.html) for what's available.

### Presets — Customize Existing Workflows

Use **presets** when you want to change *how* Spec Kit works without adding new capabilities. Presets override the templates and commands that ship with the core *and* with installed extensions — for example, enforcing a compliance-oriented spec format, using domain-specific terminology, or applying organizational standards to plans and tasks. They customize the artifacts and instructions that Spec Kit and its extensions produce.

```bash
# Search available presets
specify preset search

# Install a preset
specify preset add <preset-name>
```

For example, presets could restructure spec templates to require regulatory traceability, adapt the workflow to fit the methodology you use (e.g., Agile, Kanban, Waterfall, jobs-to-be-done, or domain-driven design), add mandatory security review gates to plans, enforce test-first task ordering, or localize the entire workflow to a different language. The [pirate-speak demo](https://github.com/mnriem/spec-kit-pirate-speak-preset-demo) shows just how deep the customization can go. Multiple presets can be stacked with priority ordering.

See the [Presets reference](https://github.github.io/spec-kit/reference/presets.html) for the full command guide, including resolution order and priority stacking.

## 📦 Bundles: Role-Based Setups

Extensions and presets are individual building blocks. A **bundle** packages a
curated set of them — extensions, presets, steps, and workflows — into a single,
versioned, role-oriented setup so a whole team persona (product manager, business
analyst, security researcher, developer, …) can be provisioned with one command.

A bundle is described by a hand-written `bundle.yml` manifest. It pins each
component to a version and, optionally, targets a specific integration; a bundle
with no `integration` is **agnostic** and inherits whatever integration the
project already uses.

```bash
# Discover bundles in the active catalog stack
specify bundle search [<query>]

# Inspect the exact component set a bundle will add (equals what install does)
specify bundle info <bundle-id>

# Install a bundle's full component set in one operation
specify bundle install <bundle-id>

# See what's installed, then update or remove non-destructively
specify bundle list
specify bundle update <bundle-id>     # or --all
specify bundle remove <bundle-id>     # removes only this bundle's components
```

Bundles resolve from a **priority-ordered catalog stack** (project > user >
built-in). Each source carries an install policy: `install-allowed` sources can
be installed from, while `discovery-only` sources are visible in `search`/`info`
but refuse installation. Manage the stack with `specify bundle catalog list|add|remove`.

Authors validate and package bundles locally. Distribution is hosting the built
artifact and adding a catalog source; community bundle submissions use the
[Bundle Submission](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/new?template=bundle_submission.yml)
issue template so required component catalogs and install evidence can be reviewed:

```bash
specify bundle validate --path ./my-bundle      # structural + reference checks
specify bundle build --path ./my-bundle         # produce a versioned .zip artifact
```

Four ready-to-read example bundle manifests live under
[`examples/bundles/`](examples/bundles/) (product manager, business analyst,
security researcher, developer). These are bundle packaging examples, not
filled generated feature specs; for end-to-end community examples, see the
[community walkthroughs](https://github.github.io/spec-kit/community/walkthroughs.html).

Key guarantees: `info` shows exactly what `install` adds (transparency);
installs are idempotent and confined to the project root; `remove` never touches
components another installed bundle still needs; and all consume/author commands
work **offline** against local or pinned sources.

### When to Use Which

| Goal | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Add a brand-new command or workflow | Extension |
| Customize the format of specs, plans, or tasks | Preset |
| Integrate an external tool or service | Extension |
| Enforce organizational or regulatory standards | Preset |
| Ship reusable domain-specific templates | Either — presets for template overrides, extensions for templates bundled with new commands |
| Provision a complete role-based setup in one command | Bundle |

## 📚 Core Philosophy

Spec-Driven Development is a structured process that emphasizes:

- **Intent-driven development** where specifications define the "*what*" before the "*how*"
- **Rich specification creation** using guardrails and organizational principles
- **Multi-step refinement** rather than one-shot code generation from prompts
- **Heavy reliance** on advanced AI model capabilities for specification interpretation

## 🌟 Development Phases

For existing projects, keep Spec Kit tooling updates separate from feature
artifact evolution: refresh managed project files when upgrading, and update
`specs/` artifacts when intended behavior changes. The
[Evolving Specs guide](./docs/guides/evolving-specs.md) describes the
recommended brownfield loop.

## 🎯 Experimental Goals
