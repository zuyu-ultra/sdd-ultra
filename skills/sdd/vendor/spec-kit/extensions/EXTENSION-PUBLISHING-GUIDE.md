## Prerequisites

Before publishing an extension, ensure you have:

1. **Valid Extension**: A working extension with a valid `extension.yml` manifest
2. **Git Repository**: Extension hosted on GitHub (or other public git hosting)
3. **Documentation**: README.md with installation and usage instructions
4. **License**: Open source license file (MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.)
5. **Versioning**: Semantic versioning (e.g., 1.0.0)
6. **Testing**: Extension tested on real projects

---

## Prepare Your Extension

### 1. Extension Structure

Ensure your extension follows the standard structure:

```text
your-extension/
├── extension.yml              # Required: Extension manifest
├── README.md                  # Required: Documentation
├── LICENSE                    # Required: License file
├── CHANGELOG.md               # Recommended: Version history
├── .gitignore                 # Recommended: Git ignore rules
│
├── commands/                  # Extension commands
│   ├── command1.md
│   └── command2.md
│
├── config-template.yml        # Config template (if needed)
│
└── docs/                      # Additional documentation
    ├── usage.md
    └── examples/
```

### 2. extension.yml Validation

Verify your manifest is valid:

```yaml
schema_version: "1.0"

extension:
  id: "your-extension"           # Unique lowercase-hyphenated ID
  name: "Your Extension Name"     # Human-readable name
  version: "1.0.0"                # Semantic version
  description: "Brief description (one sentence)"
  author: "Your Name or Organization"
  repository: "https://github.com/your-org/spec-kit-your-extension"
  license: "MIT"
  homepage: "https://github.com/your-org/spec-kit-your-extension"

requires:
  speckit_version: ">=0.1.0"    # Required spec-kit version

provides:
  commands:                       # List all commands
    - name: "speckit.your-extension.command"
      file: "commands/command.md"
      description: "Command description"

tags:                             # 2-5 relevant tags
  - "category"
  - "tool-name"
```

**Validation Checklist**:

- ✅ `id` is lowercase with hyphens only (no underscores, spaces, or special characters)
- ✅ `version` follows semantic versioning (X.Y.Z)
- ✅ `description` is concise (under 100 characters)
- ✅ `repository` URL is valid and public
- ✅ All command files exist in the extension directory
- ✅ Tags are lowercase and descriptive

### 3. Create GitHub Release

Create a GitHub release for your extension version:

```bash
# Tag the release
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# Create release on GitHub
# Go to: https://github.com/your-org/spec-kit-your-extension/releases/new
# - Tag: v1.0.0
# - Title: v1.0.0 - Release Name
# - Description: Changelog/release notes
```

The release archive URL will be:

```text
https://github.com/your-org/spec-kit-your-extension/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.zip
```

### 4. Test Installation

Test that users can install from your release:

```bash
# Test dev installation
specify extension add --dev /path/to/your-extension

# Test from GitHub archive
specify extension add <extension-name> --from https://github.com/your-org/spec-kit-your-extension/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.zip
```

## Submit to Catalog

### Understanding the Catalogs

Spec Kit uses a dual-catalog system. For details about how catalogs work, see the main [Extensions README](README.md#extension-catalogs).

**For extension publishing**: All community extensions are listed in `extensions/catalog.community.json`. Users browse this catalog and copy extensions they trust into their own `catalog.json`.

### How to Submit

To submit your extension to the community catalog, file a new issue using the **[Extension Submission](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/new?template=extension_submission.yml)** template. The template collects all required metadata, including:

- Extension ID, name, and version
- Description, author, and license
- Repository, download URL, and documentation links
- Required Spec Kit version and any tool dependencies
- Number of commands and hooks
- Tags and key features
- Testing confirmation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do **not** open a pull request directly to edit `extensions/catalog.community.json`. All community extension submissions must go through the issue template so a maintainer can review the entry and update the catalog.

### What Happens After You Submit

1. A maintainer reviews the issue during issue triage and applies the `extension-submission` label, which starts the automated catalog validation. On this public repository, contributors cannot apply that label themselves, so there is nothing to label or re-request — the issue simply waits in triage.
2. A maintainer verifies that the catalog entry is complete and correctly formatted
3. Once approved, the maintainer adds your extension to `extensions/catalog.community.json` and the Community Extensions table in the README
4. Your extension becomes discoverable via `specify extension search`

### What Maintainers Check

- The catalog entry fields are complete and correctly formatted
- The download URL is accessible
- The repository exists and contains an `extension.yml` manifest

> [!NOTE]
> Maintainers do **not** review, audit, or test the extension code itself.

### Typical Review Timeline

- **Review**: 3-7 business days

### Updating an Existing Extension

To update an extension that is already in the catalog (e.g., for a new version), file a new **[Extension Submission](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/new?template=extension_submission.yml)** issue with the updated version, download URL, and any other changed fields. Mention in the issue that this is an update to an existing entry.

---

## Release Workflow

### Publishing New Versions

When releasing a new version:

1. **Update version** in `extension.yml`:

   ```yaml
   extension:
     version: "1.1.0"  # Updated version
   ```

2. **Update CHANGELOG.md**:

   ```markdown
   ## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-15

   ### Added
   - New feature X

   ### Fixed
   - Bug fix Y
   ```

3. **Create GitHub release**:

   ```bash
   git tag v1.1.0
   git push origin v1.1.0
   # Create release on GitHub
   ```

4. **File an update submission** using the [Extension Submission](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/new?template=extension_submission.yml) template with the new version and download URL. Mention in the issue that this is an update to an existing entry.

   - Document all options
   - Include examples
   - Explain defaults

### Security

1. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
2. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Never include credentials
3. **Safe Dependencies**: Only use trusted dependencies
4. **Audit Regularly**: Check for vulnerabilities

### Maintenance

1. **Respond to Issues**: Address issues within 1-2 weeks
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
3. **Changelog**: Maintain detailed changelog
4. **Deprecation**: Give advance notice for breaking changes

### Community

1. **License**: Use permissive open-source license (MIT, Apache 2.0)
2. **Contributing**: Welcome contributions
3. **Code of Conduct**: Be respectful and inclusive
4. **Support**: Provide ways to get help (issues, discussions, email)

## FAQ

### Q: Can I publish private/proprietary extensions?

A: The main catalog is for public extensions only. For private extensions:

- Host your own catalog.json file
- Users add your catalog: `specify extension add-catalog https://your-domain.com/catalog.json`
- Not yet implemented - coming in Phase 4

### Q: How long does review take?

A: Typically 3-7 business days. Updates to existing extensions are usually faster.

### Q: What if my extension is rejected?

A: You'll receive feedback on what needs to be fixed. Make the changes and resubmit.

### Q: Can I update my extension anytime?

A: Yes, file a new [Extension Submission](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/new?template=extension_submission.yml) issue with the updated version and download URL. Mention that it is an update to an existing entry.

### Q: Do I need to be verified to be in the catalog?

A: No. All community extensions are listed in the catalog once their submission is reviewed and accepted.

### Q: Can extensions have paid features?

A: Extensions should be free and open-source. Commercial support/services are allowed, but core functionality must be free.
