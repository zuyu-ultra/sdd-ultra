# Supported AI Coding Agent Integrations

The Specify CLI supports a wide range of AI coding agents. When you run `specify init`, the CLI sets up the appropriate command files and directory structures for your chosen AI coding agent — so you can start using Spec-Driven Development immediately, regardless of which tool you prefer.

## Supported AI Coding Agents

| Agent                                                                                | Key              | Notes                                                                                                                                     |

Pass `--integration-options="--legacy-commands"` to scaffold the deprecated Bob 1.x layout (`.bob/commands/*.md`) instead; that flag will be removed in a future release. Existing legacy installs can migrate with `specify integration upgrade bob --integration-options="--skills"`, which converts them to the skills layout and removes the old command files. If preset overrides are installed, the migration is rejected with an actionable error (preset artifacts cannot yet be reconciled across a layout change) — remove the preset(s), migrate, then reinstall them. |

## List Available Integrations

```bash
specify integration list
```

| Option      | Description                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--catalog` | Also browse the catalog (built-in **and** community). Community integrations that are not built in are only shown here.  |

Shows the built-in integrations, which one is currently installed, and whether each requires a CLI tool or is IDE-based.
When multiple integrations are installed, the list marks the default integration separately from the other installed integrations.
The list also shows whether each built-in integration is declared multi-install safe.

## Search Available Integrations

```bash
specify integration search [query]
```

| Option     | Description        |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| `--tag`    | Filter by tag      |
| `--author` | Filter by author   |

Searches the active catalog stack for integrations matching the query. Without a query, lists all available integrations. Must be run inside a Spec Kit project.

## Integration Info

```bash
specify integration info <integration_id>
```

Shows catalog details for a single integration, including its description, author, license, tags, source catalog, repository (when available), and whether it is currently active. Must be run inside a Spec Kit project.

## Install an Integration

```bash
specify integration install <key>
```

| Option                   | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--script sh\|ps\|py`    | Script type: `sh` (bash/zsh), `ps` (PowerShell), or `py` (Python)        |
| `--force`                | Opt in to installing alongside integrations that are not declared multi-install safe |
| `--integration-options`  | Integration-specific options (e.g. `--integration-options="--commands-dir .myagent/cmds"`) |

Installs the specified integration into the current project. If another integration is already installed, the command only proceeds automatically when all involved integrations are declared multi-install safe. Otherwise, use `switch` to replace the default integration or pass `--force` to explicitly opt in to multi-install. If the installation fails partway through, it automatically rolls back to a clean state.

Installing an additional integration does not change the default integration. Use `specify integration use <key>` to change the default.

Installed extensions and presets are not registered for a non-default integration at install time — they follow the currently active (default) integration only. `specify integration use <key>` (or `switch <key>`) is what rescaffolds them for the newly active integration.

> **Note:** All integration management commands require a project already initialized with `specify init`. To start a new project with a specific agent, use `specify init <project> --integration <key>` instead.

**Version note:** Controlled multi-install support was introduced in Spec Kit 0.8.5. If `specify integration install <key>` says another integration is already installed and only suggests `switch` or `uninstall`, check your local CLI with `specify version` and upgrade it. Running a one-shot command such as `uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify ...` uses a temporary copy for that command only; it does not update the persistent `specify` executable on your `PATH`.

## Uninstall an Integration

```bash
specify integration uninstall [<key>]
```

| Option    | Description                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--force` | Remove files even if they have been modified         |

Uninstalls the current integration (or the specified one). Spec Kit tracks every file created during install along with a SHA-256 hash of the original content:

- **Unmodified files** are removed automatically.
- **Modified files** (where you've made manual edits) are preserved so your customizations are not lost.
- Use `--force` to remove all integration files regardless of modifications.

## Switch to a Different Integration

```bash
specify integration switch <key>
```

| Option                   | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--script sh\|ps\|py`    | Script type: `sh` (bash/zsh), `ps` (PowerShell), or `py` (Python)        |
| `--force`                | Force removal of modified files during uninstall; when the target is already installed, overwrite managed shared templates while changing the default |
| `--refresh-shared-infra` | Also overwrite shared infrastructure files even if you customized them (otherwise customizations are preserved) |
| `--integration-options`  | Options for the target integration when it is not already installed      |

If the target integration is not already installed, equivalent to running `uninstall` followed by `install` in a single step. In this mode, `--force` controls whether modified files from the removed integration are deleted. If the target integration is already installed, `switch` only changes the default integration, like `use`; in this mode, `--force` controls whether managed shared templates are overwritten while the default changes. `--integration-options` is rejected for already-installed targets because changing integration options requires reinstalling managed files; run `upgrade <key> --integration-options ...` first, then `use <key>`. Like `use`, `switch` rescaffolds installed extensions and presets for the target integration once it becomes the default.

## Use an Installed Integration

```bash
specify integration use <key>
```

| Option    | Description                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--force` | Overwrite managed shared templates while changing the default |

Sets the default integration without uninstalling any other installed integrations. This also refreshes managed shared templates so command references match the new default integration's invocation style. Modified or untracked shared templates are preserved unless `--force` is used.

`use` is also the activation point for installed extensions and presets: it re-registers every enabled extension's and preset's command overrides (and skills, for skills-mode agents) for the newly active integration, so artifacts installed while a different integration was active are rescaffolded here rather than at install time.

## Upgrade an Integration

```bash
specify integration upgrade [<key>]
```

| Option                   | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--force`                | Overwrite files even if they have been modified                          |
| `--script sh\|ps\|py`    | Script type: `sh` (bash/zsh), `ps` (PowerShell), or `py` (Python)        |
| `--integration-options`  | Options for the integration                                              |

Reinstalls an installed integration with updated templates and commands (e.g., after upgrading Spec Kit). Defaults to the default integration; if a key is provided, it must be one of the installed integrations. Detects locally modified files and blocks the upgrade unless `--force` is used. Stale files from the previous install that are no longer needed are removed automatically. Shared templates stay aligned with the default integration even when upgrading a non-default integration.

Enabled extensions and presets are re-registered only when upgrading the currently active (default) integration. A non-default upgrade still refreshes that integration's core commands, but does not re-register its extension or preset layers — `use`/`switch` that integration afterward to rescaffold them.

If an upgrade would change an integration between command and skills layouts while preset artifacts are registered for it, the upgrade is rejected before changing files. Remove the affected presets, run the layout-changing upgrade, then reinstall them.

## Report Integration Status

```bash
specify integration status
specify integration status --json
```

Reports the current project's integration status without changing files. The
status report includes the default integration, installed integrations,
multi-install safety, missing managed files, modified managed files, invalid
manifest paths, shared Spec Kit infrastructure health, unchecked manifests, and
the target integration for default-sensitive shared templates. The JSON form is
intended for CI and coding agents that need stable machine-readable status data;
it also reports the raw recorded integrations and the integration manifests that
were checked when state repair heuristics differ from the recorded file.
The command exits 0 when the report status is `ok` or `warning`; it exits 1
only when the report status is `error`. In JSON output, `multi_install_safe`
is `null` when no installed integration set can be evaluated, such as when the
integration state is missing, unreadable, lacks a valid recorded integration
list, or records no installed integrations.

## Catalog Management

Integration catalogs control where the discovery commands (`search` and `info`) look for integrations. Catalogs are checked in priority order.

### List Catalogs

```bash
specify integration catalog list
```

Shows the active catalog sources. Project-level sources (when configured) are removable by index; otherwise the active sources are shown as non-removable.

### Add a Catalog

```bash
specify integration catalog add <url>
```

| Option          | Description                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `--name <name>` | Optional name for the catalog |

Adds a custom catalog URL to the project's `.specify/integration-catalogs.yml`. The URL must use HTTPS (except `http://localhost`, `http://127.0.0.1`, or `http://[::1]` for local testing).

### Remove a Catalog

```bash
specify integration catalog remove <index>
```

Removes a project catalog source by its 0-based index in `catalog list`.

### Catalog Resolution Order

Catalogs are resolved in this order (first match wins):

1. **Environment variable** — `SPECKIT_INTEGRATION_CATALOG_URL` overrides all catalogs
2. **Project config** — `.specify/integration-catalogs.yml`
3. **User config** — `~/.specify/integration-catalogs.yml`
4. **Built-in defaults** — official catalog + community catalog

## Integration-Specific Options

Some integrations accept additional options via `--integration-options`:

| Integration | Option              | Description                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `generic`   | `--commands-dir`    | Required. Directory for command files                          |
| `kimi`      | `--migrate-legacy`  | Migrate legacy `.kimi/skills/` installs to `.kimi-code/skills/` (including dotted→hyphenated skill naming, e.g. `speckit.xxx` → `speckit-xxx`) |
| `copilot`   | `--commands`        | Scaffold `.github/agents/*.agent.md` commands with `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` companions and merge `.vscode/settings.json` instead of using the default skills layout. |
| `copilot`   | `--skills`          | Force the default skills layout, overriding an existing commands layout during an explicit migration. |

Example:

```bash
specify integration install generic --integration-options="--commands-dir .myagent/cmds"
```

## Scaffold a New Integration

```bash
specify integration scaffold <key>
```

Creates a minimal built-in integration package and a matching test skeleton in the Spec Kit repository, then prints the next steps for wiring it up. Run this command from the Spec Kit repository root. The `<key>` must be lowercase kebab-case (for example, `my-agent`).

| Option   | Description                                                       |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--type` | Scaffold template to use: `markdown` (default), `skills`, `toml`, or `yaml` |

## FAQ

### Can I install multiple integrations in the same project?

Yes, but it is intended for team portability rather than the default workflow. Multiple integrations are allowed automatically only when the installed integration and the new integration are declared multi-install safe by Spec Kit. For other combinations, pass `--force` to acknowledge that multiple agents may see unrelated agent-specific instructions or commands.

Spec Kit tracks one default integration in `.specify/integration.json` with `default_integration`, all installed integrations with `installed_integrations`, per-integration runtime settings with `integration_settings`, and a dedicated `integration_state_schema` for future state migrations. The legacy `integration` field remains as an alias for the default integration.

### Which integrations are multi-install safe?

An integration is multi-install safe when it uses a static, unique agent root and command directory, stable command invocation settings, and a separate install manifest whose managed files do not overlap another safe integration. Registry tests enforce those path and manifest invariants. Shared Spec Kit templates remain aligned to the single default integration.

The Command directory column below lists the directory each integration installs its commands or skills into. Context-file targeting is a separate concern from integration multi-install safety: `multi_install_safe` is an integration declaration about command/skill paths, whereas the optional agent-context extension manages a per-agent context file (for example `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`) and can even synchronize several anchors at once via its `context_files` setting. Multiple agents mapping to the same context file is expected there and does not affect whether an integration is multi-install safe; see the agent-context extension for details.

The currently declared multi-install safe integrations are:

| Key | Command directory |
| --- | ----------------- |
| `alquimia` | `.alquimia/skills` |
| `auggie` | `.augment/commands` |
| `claude` | `.claude/skills` |
| `cline` | `.clinerules/workflows` |
| `codebuddy` | `.codebuddy/commands` |
| `codex` | `.agents/skills` |
| `command-code` | `.commandcode/skills` |
| `cursor-agent` | `.cursor/skills` |
| `droid` | `.factory/skills` |
| `firebender` | `.firebender/commands` |
| `gemini` | `.gemini/commands` |
| `grok` | `.grok/skills` |
| `junie` | `.junie/commands` |
| `kilocode` | `.kilo/commands` |
| `kiro-cli` | `.kiro/prompts` |
| `lingma` | `.lingma/skills` |
| `omp` | `.omp/commands` |
| `pi` | `.pi/prompts` |
| `qodercli` | `.qoder/commands` |
| `qwen` | `.qwen/commands` |
| `shai` | `.shai/commands` |
| `tabnine` | `.tabnine/agent/commands` |
| `trae` | `.trae/skills` |
| `zcode` | `.zcode/skills` |

Integrations that share a command directory with another integration, require dynamic install paths such as `--commands-dir`, or merge shared tool settings are not declared safe by default. They can still be installed alongside another integration with `--force`.

### What happens to my changes when I uninstall or switch?

Files you've modified are preserved automatically. Only unmodified files (matching their original SHA-256 hash) are removed. Use `--force` to override this.

### How do I know which key to use?

Run `specify integration list` to see all available integrations with their keys, or check the [Supported AI Coding Agents](#supported-ai-coding-agents) table above.

### Do I need the AI coding agent installed to use an integration?

CLI-based integrations (like Claude Code, Gemini CLI) require the tool to be installed. IDE-based integrations (like Cursor) work through the IDE itself. Some agents like GitHub Copilot support both IDE and CLI usage. `specify integration list` shows which type each integration is.

### When should I use `upgrade` vs `switch`?

Use `upgrade` when you've upgraded Spec Kit and want to refresh an installed integration's managed files. Use `switch` when you want to replace the current default with another integration; if the target is already installed, `switch` behaves like `use`.

### Do extensions and presets I install apply to every installed integration?

No. Extensions (`specify extension add`) and presets (`specify preset add`) register their command overrides for the currently active (default) integration only, even if other integrations are installed. A non-default integration does not receive those artifacts until it becomes the default: `specify integration use <key>` (or `switch <key>`) rescaffolds every enabled extension and preset for the newly active integration. `specify integration upgrade` follows the same rule — it only re-registers extensions and presets when upgrading the active integration.
